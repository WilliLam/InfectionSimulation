Created using Netlogo, this program tries to simulate the spread of a deadly disease through a small, village-sized population.

Instructions:
1. Download NetLogo from <b>[here.](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)</b>
2. Open NetLogo and open `villageinfect.nlogo`.
3. Edit variables, then press setup and go.

Issues:
Opening `villageinfect.nlogo` gives model out-of-date warning. However, it's fine to just ignore the warning.
